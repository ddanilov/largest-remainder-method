# Intro

This project demonstrates implementation of a simple but not too trivial problem
in different programming languages. The problem at hand is distribution with
rest by [largest remainder method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method).

The goal is to implement a command line program that

  * reads input data from a file,
  * does the distribution calculation,
  * prints the results.

Each implementation will contain

  * unit tests for the distribution calculation,
  * instructions how to get the corresponding code coverage report,
  * continuous integration workflows for testing on some source code hosting
    platforms.
